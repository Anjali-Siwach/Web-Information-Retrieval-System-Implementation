# Web-Information-Retrieval-System-Implementation
Implemented web crawling, indexing . Demonstrated practical knowledge and understanding of fundamental concepts in web information retrieval .  Developed a robust technical skill set, encompassing web crawling, indexing, search engine implementation
The project titled "Web Information Retrieval System Implementation" aims to develop a comprehensive web crawling and search system to retrieve and index web content efficiently and provide users with relevant search results. This project encompasses several key components, including the web crawler, web page parser, indexing engine, and search engine, each contributing to the overall functionality of the system.The web crawler component serves as the system's entry point into the web. It commences its journey with a seed URL and systematically constructs a web graph that represents the interconnected nature of web pages A dedicated web page parser is developed to extract meaningful content from the web pages crawled. This parser is capable of processing HTML to remove irrelevant tags and retain essential text and metadata. The indexing engine forms the backbone of the system, efficiently storing the extracted content and associating it with the corresponding URLs. The search engine component offers a user-friendly interface (CLI) that allows users to input queries and retrieve relevant web pages
